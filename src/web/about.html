                    <h3>Support & Issues</h3>
                    <p>Found a bug or have a suggestion? Please open an issue on 
                    <a href="https://github.com/kthorn/cocktaildb">GitHub</a>. As this is a hobby project, 
                    I may not be able to fix them immediately, but I appreciate your feedback.</p>

                    <h3>About The Code</h3>
                    <p>The code is open source and available on <a href="https://github.com/kthorn/cocktaildb">GitHub</a>. 
                        Feel free to fork it and use it for your own purposes.</p>
                    <p>It was largely vibe coded with Claude, so the code may be a bit messy. The database is a SQLite database, 
                        and the API runs via FastAPI on AWS Lambda. It's quite cheap to run.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Cheers and enjoy exploring!</strong></p>
