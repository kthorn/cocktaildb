                    <p>Welcome to my cocktail database - a hobby project to track cocktails and ingredients.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Why I Built This</h3>
                    <p>Most cocktail databases treat ingredients as flat lists—but that misses how cocktails actually work. 
                       A Margarita and a Daiquiri are structurally similar (spirit + citrus + sweetener), even though they 
                       use different specific ingredients. I wanted a database that captures these relationships.</p>
                    
                    <p>A core component of this project is a hierarchical ingredient schema. Ingredients are organized 
                       into a tree structure: "Four Roses Bourbon" is a child of "Bourbon" which in turn is a child of "Whiskey".
                       This hierarchy enables analytics and search capabilities that a 
                       flat database can't match.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Analytics & Data Science</h3>
                    <p>The hierarchical structure unlocks interesting data analysis. Check out the <a href="analytics.html">Analytics page</a> to explore:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Ingredient usage patterns</strong> - See which ingredient categories appear most frequently, 
                            with drill-down into specific items</li>
                        <li><strong>Ingredient hierarchy tree</strong> - Interactive visualization of the 
                            ingredient taxonomy with recipe counts</li>
                        <li><strong>Recipe complexity analysis</strong> - Understand the distribution of cocktail complexity 
                            across the database</li>
                        <li><strong>Cocktail similarity mapping</strong> - Using UMAP embeddings based on ingredient overlap, 
                            visualize "cocktail space" and see which drinks are structurally similar</li>
                        <li><strong>EM-learned embeddings</strong> - By rolling up ingredients to their parent categories and 
                            using expectation-maximization to learn ingredient distances, we get even richer similarity metrics 
                            that reveal the underlying structure of cocktail families</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>Sign up for a free account to:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Rate and review cocktail recipes</li>
                        <li>Add personal tags to organize your favorites</li>
                        <li>Track your ingredient inventory</li>
                        <li>Search for cocktails you can make with ingredients on hand</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Signing up for an account requires an email address. This is solely to allow you to reset your password if you forget it
                       and because the AWS Cognito authorization flow expects an email address. I do not use your email for any other purpose and will 
                       not share it with anyone or send any emails other than the ones you receive from Cognito.</p>

                    <p>To maintain data quality for the analytics features described above, only editors can add new recipes and ingredients. 
                    If you'd like to become an editor or have recipes to contribute, please contact me at 
                    <a href="mailto:kurt.thorn@gmail.com">kurt.thorn@gmail.com</a>.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Support & Issues</h3>
                    <p>Found a bug or have a suggestion? Please open an issue on 
                    <a href="https://github.com/kthorn/cocktaildb">GitHub</a>. As this is a hobby project, 
                    I may not be able to fix them immediately, but I appreciate your feedback.</p>

                    <h3>Open Source & Open Data</h3>
                    <p>This is both an open source and open data project. The code is available on 
                        <a href="https://github.com/kthorn/cocktaildb">GitHub</a>, and the full database of recipes and 
                        ingredients is freely available for download. Feel free to fork it, use the data for your own 
                        projects, or contribute improvements.</p>

                            Download latest database backup
                        </a>
                        <span id="backup-download-status">Loading latest backup...</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>It was largely vibe coded with Claude, so the code may be a bit messy. The database is PostgreSQL, 
                        and the API runs via FastAPI on AWS EC2. It's quite cheap to run.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Cheers and enjoy exploring!</strong></p>
