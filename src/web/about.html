                    <h3>What You Can Do</h3>
                    <p>Sign up for a free account to:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Rate and review cocktail recipes</li>
                        <li>Add personal tags to organize your favorites</li>

                    </ul>
                    <p>Signing up for an account requires an email address. This is solely to allow you to reset your password if you forget it
                       and because the AWS Cognito authorization flow expects an email address. I do not use your email for any other purpose and will 
                       not share it with anyone or send any emails other than the ones you receive from Cognito.</p>

                    <h3>About The Code</h3>
                    <p>The code is open source and available on <a href="https://github.com/kthorn/cocktaildb">GitHub</a>. 
                        Feel free to fork it and use it for your own purposes.</p>
                    <p>
                        <a id="backup-download-link" class="btn btn-secondary" href="#" aria-disabled="true">
                            Download latest database backup
                        </a>
                        <span id="backup-download-status">Loading latest backup...</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>It was largely vibe coded with Claude, so the code may be a bit messy. The database is PostgreSQL, 
                        and the API runs via FastAPI on AWS EC2. It's quite cheap to run.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Cheers and enjoy exploring!</strong></p>
